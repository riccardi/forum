Deployed on Heroku at https://intense-depths-21147.herokuapp.com

Anyone can add a post or comment on a post or another comment. All comments are threaded.
I started working on Users and Authentication but couldn't get it up and running the way I wanted to.

# Left to Do:
- User Authentication
  - Login & Sign Up
  - OAuth with Google, Facebook, & Twitter
- Direct Messaging
- Associating Users with Post and comments
- Design
- File upload to an Amazon S3 bucket with new posts
- Ability for user to edit and delete their own posts/comments
